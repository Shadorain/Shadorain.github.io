# Topic: Doom Emacs Configuration (Jul 12, 2020)
* All things doom should be customized from within the `~/.doom.d/` directory
* This dir contains: 
    * `init.el`: select all doom packages here
    * `config.el`: where most user defined edits should be
    * `packages.el`: used for defining packages to be installed

## Sub Topic: Doom binary
* There is a binary in `~/.emacs.d/bin/` named `doom`
* setting that directory in PATH alows for using this binary anywhere in a terminal
* the binary contains quite a few necessary commands so this is recommended
* Commands:
    * `doom install`: installs all new added packages and recompiles
    * `doom sync`: syncs up files and practically reloads the config
    * `doom update`: finds any updates to doom and patches them in
