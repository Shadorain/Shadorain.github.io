I enjoy ricing my system up quite alot, gotta be pretty (pretty good too)! I’m quite an extremist in my tastes and technology philosophy. | Linux &gt; All other OS’s | Window Managers &gt; Desktop Environments | Tiling &gt; Floating (of course!) | Vim + Emacs &gt; All other editors (especially vsc) | Purple is the best color haha! | . Security . I love all things low level. Whether that is C language or Assembly. Within security topic, Reversing and Binary Exploitation have been lethaly intriguing to me. They are what i plan to study mainly and love doing the most with in CTF’s. I’m not incopetent in other sects of security, all though I dont enjoy them as much, I understand cryptography and forensics a bit as well as other things. None of which are as cool as rev and binexp though!! . ",
