<h3 id="what-i-run">What i run</h3>
<p>I currently run Arch linux as my main operating system, even though I would much rather be on LFS. One day when its actually viable as a daily driver! I enjoy ricing my system up quite alot, gotta be pretty (pretty good too)! 
Iâ€™m quite an extremist in my tastes and technology philosophy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Linux &gt; All other OSâ€™s</li>
  <li>Window Managers &gt; Desktop Environments</li>
  <li>Tiling &gt; Floating (of course!)</li>
  <li>Vim + Emacs &gt; All other editors (especially vsc)</li>
  <li>Purple is the best color haha!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="security">Security</h3>
<p>I love all things low level (low level meaning as close to the machine code as one can get). Whether that is C language or Assembly. Within security topic, Reversing and Binary Exploitation have been lethaly intriguing to me. They are what i plan to study mainly and love doing the most with in CTFâ€™s.<br />
Iâ€™m not incopetent in other sects of security, all though I dont enjoy them as much, I understand cryptography and forensics a bit as well as other things. None of which are as cool as rev and binexp though!!</p>
