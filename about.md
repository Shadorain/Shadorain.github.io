## Hobbies

### What I run

Currently, I dual boot Gentoo with Void Linux, both of which are fabulous OS's and quite minimal. Gentoo intrigues me daily with its solely source based repositories allowing for fully unique binaries in my system which increases security and much more. I enjoy ricing my system up quite alot as well, gotta be pretty (pretty good too)! 
Here is a breakdown:
- Linux (custom kernel on gentoo)
- Tiling Window Managers ([Xmonad](https://github.com/Shadorain/shadoXmonad)[main], dwm, bspwm)
- [Vim/Neovim](https://github.com/Shadorain/shadovim) for all, but Emacs Org-mode for school or notes
- Purple is my favorite color in almost all shades so I created a [custom colorscheme](https://github.com/Shadorain/shadotheme) to match this!

### Security

I love all things low level (low level meaning as close to the machine code as one can get). Whether that is C language or Assembly. Within security topic, Reversing and Binary Exploitation have been quite intriguing to me. Either this or Kernel/Driver development is what I would like to pursue.
I'm not incopetent in other sects of security though, I understand networking and general penetration testing well also but I mainly stick to the more Computer Science geared side of Security.
