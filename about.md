## Hobbies
### What i run
I currently run Arch linux as my main operating system, even though I would much rather be on LFS. One day when its actually viable as a daily driver! I enjoy ricing my system up quite alot, gotta be pretty (pretty good too)! 
I'm quite an extremist in my tastes and technology philosophy.  
- Linux > All other OS's
- Window Managers > Desktop Environments
- Tiling > Floating windows (of course!)
- Vim + Emacs > All other editors (especially vsc)
- Purple is the best color haha!

### Security
I love all things low level (low level meaning as close to the machine code as one can get). Whether that is C language or Assembly. Within security topic, Reversing and Binary Exploitation have been lethaly intriguing to me. They are what i plan to study mainly and love doing the most with in CTF's.  
I'm not incopetent in other sects of security, all though I dont enjoy them as much, I understand cryptography and forensics a bit as well as other things. None of which are as cool as rev and binexp though!!
